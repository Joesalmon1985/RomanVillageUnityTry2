# Progress

What was built and what actually ran, per milestone. Newest last.

## Milestone 0: skeleton and shared contracts (13 Nov 2026)

Built:
- Assemblies: `World.Sim` (no engine references, Newtonsoft only), `World.Game` (refs World.Sim, Bedsit.Core), `World.Sim.Tests` (EditMode), `World.Game.Tests` (PlayMode).
- Sim core: `Rng` (SplitMix64), `Ware`, partial `WorldState` and `PlayerState`, `Command`/`CommandResult`/`ICommandHandler`, `SimEvent`/`EventBuffer`, `ISimSystem` with `SystemOrder` slots, `WorldSim` (Submit, Step at 10 ticks/s, DrainEvents), `Reasons` (closed list and sentences), `WorldSimFactory` with empty Economy, Strategy and Military module stubs; Ward and Rhythm namespace placeholders.
- Board: `HexCoord`, `Terrain`, `BoardTopology` (radius R, int ids, adjacency, exact pointy-top geometry at 20 m per edge, BFS paths with an edge filter), `Board`, `BoardGenerator.CreateMvpBoard(seed)`.
- Game: `Assets/Scenes/World.unity` (one `WorldBootstrap`), `GameClock` with pause reasons, sun, camera at the home city, 400 m ground plane, `MaterialFactory` with two own shaders kept in builds through Resources materials, `UiStyle`. World.unity is the only build scene; `AgentScripts/BuildWindows.cs` targets `Builds/Windows/WorldMVP.exe`.
- Fast harness: `DotNet/WorldMVP.sln` runs the EditMode test sources under .NET 10.
- Contracts for parallel agents: `Docs/CONTRACTS.md`.

Ran:
- `dotnet test DotNet`: 43 passed, 0 failed.
- Unity recompile: completed, 0 compile errors; `unity command console status`: 0 errors (1 warning: Unity's Input Manager deprecation notice).
- `unity command test run --mode editor`: 43 passed, 0 failed (same sources as the .NET run).
- `unity command test run --mode playmode --async-tests`: 1 passed (`WorldBootTests.WorldScene_Boots_AndSimTicks`: scene loads, one bootstrap, sim ticks, pause reasons hold the clock).
- Play Mode capture `Evidence/screenshots/m0_boot.png` (git-ignored), inspected: green ground to the horizon under the default sky, debug overlay showing the tick advancing.

Not run: no Windows player build (not part of M0); nothing beyond the M0 gate.

## Milestone 1: walkable village (13 Nov 2026)

Built (all in `Assets/World/Game`, generated from `WorldBootstrap`; API for the next agents in `Docs/GAME_API.md`):
- Terrain: one flat walkable tile per hex (mesh collider, tinted, inspectable `HexView`), trees, rocks and low mounds, crop rows, convex-collider mountain peaks; pale edge lines and a post with disc and pennant at every vertex; hex labels in God View only; outskirts trees and hills; invisible circular bounds plus an avatar clamp; gradient sky dome, fog, trilight ambient. New shaders `World/Unlit`, `World/Glow` (additive), `World/Text` (depth-tested TextMesh), shipped through Resources materials.
- Village: paved 30 m square at the home vertex with curb, lamps and benches; enterable storehouse with door and sign; market stall with keeper spot; town bell (E rings it, `TownBell.Rung`); warehouse 24 m from spawn with neon door, coloured light spill and hue-cycling lights, dance floor, DJ decks, bar annex and ramp-reached balcony behind striped barriers (`WarehouseSet.SetRouteOpen`), procedurally synthesised 174 BPM drum loop at the door (3D, low-passed outside).
- Player: `FirstPersonAvatar` (CharacterController, locks), `GodCamera` (ortho), `ViewSwitcher` (Tab), `Picker` + `IInspectable`/`IInteractable`, `InspectPanel`, `BoardPicker`, `BoardSpace`.
- People: `PlaceholderActor` (procedural idle, walk swing, wave/greet/cheer/cast/clap/surprise/stretch), `ActorFactory`, `Npc`, `DialoguePanel`; Mira, Juno (door host), DJ Sol (decks), Quartermaster Bram, Hesta, Captain Orla, Scribe Pell.
- `EncounterHost`/`IEncounter`/`EncounterContext`/`EncounterDirectory` with `DebugEncounter`; `Hud` (crosshair, prompt, view, clock, objective, Esc pause menu); `AutoPlay` with `-autoplay <name>` and the `boot_tour` script.
- Agent scripts: `AgentScripts/M1Captures.cs` (capture states, boot_tour, fps), `AgentScripts/GameViewSize.cs` (Game view 1920x1080); `MakeWorldScene.cs` also creates the new Resources materials.

Ran:
- Unity recompile: 0 compile errors; `unity command console status`: 0 errors after the final runs (1 warning: Input Manager deprecation notice).
- `unity command test run --mode editor`: 43 passed, 0 failed (no sim changes in this milestone).
- `unity command test run --mode playmode --async-tests`: 9 passed, 0 failed: `WorldBootTests.WorldScene_Boots_AndSimTicks`; `VillageTests.Scene_Boots_WithVillage` (one avatar, one bootstrap/sim, 7 NPCs = the six roles plus the doorman, storehouse, market, bell, warehouse; Mira and Juno within 25 m and in the spawn camera view; door under 40 m from the square), `Walk_FromSpawn_ReachesMiraAndDoorHost_GreetingShows` (walk speed: Mira 0.84 s, Juno 3.89 s; greeting shown inside 4 m), `Tab_WhileWalkingAndInspecting_KeepsAvatarAndSelection` (twice: position under 1 mm, yaw/pitch under 0.1 deg, same sim, selection kept, no movement and marker in God View), `EncounterHost_DebugEncounter_PausesSurvivesTabAndRestores` (tick unchanged while running, survives Tab both ways, exact restore, clock resumes; abort path), `EncounterDirectory_And_DialogueOptions`, `Warehouse_SetRouteOpen_TogglesBarrierAndLights`, `Warehouse_Routes_BlockedWhenClosed_WalkableWhenOpen` (scripted walks into the bar and up the ramp onto the balcony deck, blocked when closed; walk door to decks, DJ greets), `BoardSpace_And_BoardPicker_RoundTrip`.
- Play Mode `boot_tour` via AutoPlay in the editor: logged `[AutoPlay] boot_tour OK` (editor does not quit; the `-autoplay` flag in a packaged player was not run).
- Captures at 1920x1080 in Play Mode, inspected and iterated (git-ignored, `Evidence/screenshots/`): `m1_spawn.png` (Mira, Juno and the lit warehouse door in view), `m1_godview.png` (whole settlement and most of the board with hex graph, labels and avatar marker; Storehouse selected), `m1_warehouse_interior.png` (dance floor, decks with DJ Sol, bar barrier, balcony), `m1_dialogue.png` (Mira's dialogue, duel option "Not available yet"), `m1_pause.png`.
- Editor frame rate at 1920x1080 (Game view, smoothed): 260 to 400 fps across the five capture states.

Not run: no Windows player build and no packaged `-autoplay boot_tour` run; no human playtest; audio was not listened to (the loop is generated and plays, volume and mix unchecked by ear).
